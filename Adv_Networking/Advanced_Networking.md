* A static route may be required when we need to reach an outside network that the default gateway can not access
* Configuring a a Network Bridge interface will be required for a virtualization environment
* A bridge interface will allow virtual machines to have access to an external network
* To provide bandwidth availability, redundancy and load balance; we need to configure link aggregation or network teaming
* We will configure IPv6 addressing, as it it generally a good idea to do so (as IPv4 range exhaustion is foreseeable)
