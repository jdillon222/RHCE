### Instructions for advanced Linux systems and networking administration, covering tasks required within the RHCE exam.

###  The examples contained herein, will generally utilize a main server (hostname=masterhost06, 10.0.2.6), on a local domain named jdillon.local.  Clients configured on the network generally follow the naming convention 'vm##', where ## is the two digit ending of the client's ip address.

#### These notes have been inspired by working through the material within [Sander Van Vugt's Red Hat RHCSA ®/ RHCE® 7 Cert Guide](https://www.sandervanvugt.com/book-red-hat-rhcsa-rhce-7-cert-guide/) and [Michael Jang & Alessandro Orsario's RHCSA/RHCE Red Hat Linux Certification Study Guide, Seventh Edition](https://www.amazon.com/RHCSA-Linux-Certification-Study-Seventh/dp/0071841962), as well as selections of web content.
